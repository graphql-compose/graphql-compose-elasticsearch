  \\"\\"\\"
  A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries.
  The bool query maps to Lucene BooleanQuery. It is built using one or more

A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries.
The bool query maps to Lucene BooleanQuery. It is built using one or more
